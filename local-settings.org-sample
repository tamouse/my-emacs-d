Copy this to ~local-settings.org~ and modify the path to where your org files live. If you don't have ~org-directory~ set before ~common.org~ is loaded, Emacs Org-Mode will assume your org files live at "~/org" (which isn't necessarily a bad choice).

NOTE: Do not forget the trailing slash for the ~org-directory~ setting. It's prepended to all the necessary files.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-directory (expand-file-name "~/GoogleDrive/org/"))
#+END_SRC
